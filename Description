 Certainly! Changing the **photo path** attribute to store only the filename (e.g., `item.jpg`) rather than the full path is a straightforward adjustment. Here's the updated description for your Closet Database:

   - **Category**: The type of clothing or accessory (e.g., shirt, pants, jacket).

   - **Material**: Fabric or material type (e.g., cotton, polyester, leather).

   - **Condition**: Current state of the item (e.g., new, gently used, worn).
   - **Date Acquired**: When the item was purchased or received.
   - **Cost**: Purchase price or estimated value.
   - **Photo Filename**: The filename of an image associated with the item (e.g., `shirt_black.jpg`).
   - **Location**: Where the item is stored (e.g., closet, drawer, storage box).

3. **Search and Filter**:  
   - Quickly search for items based on attributes like color, size, or category.
   - Filter items to create lists (e.g., “All black shirts” or “Winter outerwear”).

4. **Budget Tracking**:

### **Technical Notes**
1. **Photo Storage**:
   - The database will store only the filename of each image (e.g., `jacket_blue.jpg`).
   - Images should be kept in a dedicated folder (e.g., `images/`) for easy retrieval.

2. **Example File Structure**:
   ```
   project/
   ├── main.py
   ├── clothing.db
   ├── images/
       ├── shirt_black.jpg
       ├── jacket_blue.jpg
       ├── shoes_red.jpg
   ```

3. **Query Updates**:  
   - Ensure image display logic prepends the folder path when needed (e.g., `"images/" + photo_filename`).
